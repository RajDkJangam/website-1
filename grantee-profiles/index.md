These Frictionless Data Tool Fund posts are part of the grantee profile series, written to shine a light on Frictionless Dataâ€™s Tool Fund grantees, their work and to let our technical community know how they can get involved. Frictionless Data Tool Fund grantees are individuals and organizations that Open Knowledge International has commissioned to extend implementation of Frictionless Data libraries in additional programming languages.
