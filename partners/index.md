**Data Management for TEDDINET (DM4T)** is set up to support TEDDINET
(Transforming Energy Demand through Digital Innovation Network)
collectively to construct a data legacy for the TEDDI, BuildTEDDI and
the non-domestic buildings programmes as a whole.

OKI and DM4T will work together on a proof-of-concept pilot around

**Stephen Eglen**, a Reader in Computational Neuroscience at the
University of Cambridge, is working with us to investigate the
applicability of the Data Package concept to facilitate data reuse.

Together, we are trialling tools for packaging and reading nervous
system data using R.

**The Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC)** provides a
technological and legal infrastructure for regional data sharing to
support an open data ecosystem. The WPRDC manages an open data portal
(using [CKAN](http://ckan.org/)), and provides a number of services to
data publishers and users in public sector agencies, academic
institutions, and non-profit organizations.

We are working with the WPRDC to pilot various tools for making data
quality more visible on CKAN.
