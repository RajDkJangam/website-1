We are digital natives, dazzled by the boundless information and cultural resources of electronic networks, tuned in to a life on - and offline. I grew up immersed in the wonders of creative code on Apple ][ and DOS-era personal computers, and hacked my way into doing fun things in plenty of programming environments, from [BASIC](https://www.scullinsteel.com/apple2/) to C++/C#/.NET (hey [@ooswald](https://github.com/ooswald)) to Perl (hey [@virtualsue](https://github.com/virtualsue)!) to Java (hey [@timcolson](https://github.com/timcolson)!) to JavaScript (hey [@jermolene](https://github.com/jermolene)!) to Python (hey [@gasman](https://github.com/gasman)!), all of which I use, in various combinations, in my freelance work based in Switzerland, a country of [plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_people).

Over the years, I have tried other languages like Clojure and Pascal, Groovy and Go, Erlang and Haskell, but despite excellent documentation and the good intentions of well-meaning, encouraging friends, none of these has stuck in my dev chain. I hope to have a working grasp of what Scala and the R Project are about, while mastering [ARM C/C++](https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/compilers) and [x86 assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language) craft of working on code and data with care, and the wisdom to avoid jumping off every tempting new thing on the horizon.

I first came across tendrils of Open Knowledge ten years ago while living in Oxford, a vibrant community of thinkers and civic reformers. With some friends we started a [hackspace](https://oxhack.org/), got involved in extracurricular open source activities, and joined barcamps and hackathons. I started to see many of the so-called 'big IT' or 'enterprise software' challenges to be, on many levels, problems of incompatible or intractable data standards.

Helping to start an [Open Knowledge chapter](http://make.opendata.ch/) presented the opportunity to be involved in an ambitious and exciting techno-political movement, and learn from some of the most deeply ethical and forward-thinking people in Information Technology. Helping to support [projects](http://forum.schoolofdata.ch/) in the Swiss [Opendata.ch](https://opendata.ch) association and international network is today no longer just a weekend activity: it is my master branch.

I first heard the term 'frictionless' from a [philosopher](https://andrewjtaggart.com/) who warned of a world where IT removes friction to the point where we live anywhere, and do anything, at the cost of social alienation - and, along with it, grave consequences to our well-being. There are parallels here to "closed datasets", which may well be padlocked for a reason. Throwing them into the wind may deprive them of the nurturing care of the original owners. The open data community offers them a softer landing.

I first heard about Frictionless Data at [OKCon 2013](https://opendata.ch/2013/09/okcon-2013-some-swiss-highlights/), shortly after the project was announced. While I was  busy [mining the  Law](https://make.opendata.ch/legal/), Max Ogden [mentioned](https://vimeo.com/channels/okcon2013/79932550) the idea in his [talk](https://okcon.org/technology-tools-and-business/session-4/) on [Dat Project](https://datproject.org/). Soon after, it became a regular topic in the [Labs hangouts](http://okfnlabs.org/) and other places.

My first impression was mixed: I liked the idea in principle, but found it hard to foresee what the standardization process could accomplish. It took me a couple of years to catch up, gain experience in putting the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/) and its [related tools](http://licenses.opendefinition.org/) to use, struggle with some of the fundamental issues myself - just to wholly accept accept the idea of an open data ecosystem. Thank you [Rufus Pollock](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock), especially for being persistent and patient.

Working with more unwieldy data and having an interest in Data Science boosted by recent [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.ch/) collaborations, the great vibe of a growing community, all led me to test the waters with [the Julia language](https://julialang.org).  I quickly became a fan, and started looking for ways to include it in my workflow and workshops. Thanks to the Frictionless Data Tool Fund, I will be able to focus on this goal and start connecting the dots more quickly.
More bridges need to be built to help open data users use Julia's computing environment, and Julia users could use sturdier access to open data.

Over the years, I have made small contributions to OKI’s codebases on projects like [CKAN](https://ckan.org). Contributing to the Frictionless Data project clears the way and enables me to work at the frontlines of development: putting better tools in users’ hands, committing directly to the needs of the community, setting an elevated expectation of responsibility and quality.

There are two use cases which I think are particularly interesting when it comes to Frictionless Data: strongly typed and easy to validate dataset schema leading to a "light" version of semantic interoperability, helping data analysts, developers, even automated agents, to see at a glance how compatible datasets might be.

The other is the pipelines approach which, as a [feature of Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix) and [other OSs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/powershell/scripting/getting-started/fundamental/understanding-the-windows-powershell-pipeline?view=powershell-5.1) became the basis for an incredibly powerful system building tool, and is now laying the foundation of a rich and reliable world of [shared data](http://datahub.io/blog/core-data-essential-datasets-for-data-wranglers-and-data-scientists).

That said, I am still a novice in Julia. I will make mistakes and may reinvent wheels by accident - wheels that I will be extra eager to improve and refactor. My initial ambition is modest: make a working set of tools, produce a stable [v1.0 specification](https://blog.okfn.org/2017/09/05/frictionless-data-v1-0/) release. Run tests, get reviewed, interact with the community, and iterate. This project will be a learning process, and my intention is to widen the goalposts as much as I can for others to follow. Besides my [open dev log](http://github.com/loleg/devlog) (which will at some point have a proper home), I will be developing the [datapackage-jl](https://github.com/loleg/datapackage-jl) and [tableschema-jl](https://github.com/loleg/tableschema-jl) libraries on GitHub, and have already started putting Frictionless Data libraries to use in the Open Data community.

In closing: Data Packages are more than machine+human-readable format for sharing metadata. We did not really understand the need for CSV, SVG or PDF back when everyone used the same document editor (remember [WordPerfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPerfect#Key_characteristics)?). Today, the reasons for having portable intermediate formats are clear to everyone. For the past years, we have been used to working with a small set of data portals - now their [number](http://dataportals.org) has [exploded](https://opendatainception.io), and more importantly the diversity of uses for metadata has dramatically increased.

The Julia language needs to be better known, so I will start threads on the [Open Knowledge forums](https://discuss.okfn.org/u/loleg), at the [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/), and in technical and academic circles. I am likewise really looking forward to representing Frictionless Data in the diverse and wide-ranging [Julia community](https://julialang.org/community/), sharing whatever questions and needs arise both ways. The specifications, libraries and tools will help to preserve key metadata on widely used datasets, foster a more in-depth technical discussion between everyone involved in data sharing, and open the door to more critical feedback loops between creators, publishers and users of open data.

Please feel free to [write me a note](http://datalets.ch/), send in your use case, respond to anything I'm working on or writing about, share a tricky dataset or any other kind of challenge - and [let's chat](https://gitter.im/frictionlessdata/chat)!
